## Crescenzo D'Alterio


I am a tech / video games / science geek who could spend hours just reading about new technologies.

Working as a Data Analyst, I realised that the days I enjoyed the most were the ones where something went 'wrong', and I needed to find ways to solve the problems,
whether that's using new software or writing a simple script using the basic knowledge of programming I had.

I therefore decided to join Makers Academy, a highly intensive 16 weeks coding bootcamp, which has enabled me to learn so much in such a short period of time, it's still hard to believe.

My dream would be now to join a team where I can apply all I've learned in a working environment, whilst still learning.


## Skills

#### Passion driven

The reason I have relocated to London is because eventually I wanted to try and find a job as a developer. It took me two years to be in a position in which I could leave my job and seriously commit to my passion, but I made it!

Doing something you thoroughly enjoy is the quickest way to excellence in my opinion.





#### Hungry (or Thirsty?) for knowledge

I genuinely find learning new things (especially tech related subjects) very exciting.  

The thing that I definitely took out of my learning experience at Makers is not simply how to write code in Ruby or Javascript, but really how to learn new skills with the least possible guidance, finding differences and similarities with what I already know. I now feel very excited about the chance of testing these new abilities in a real life scenario.


#### Teaching/Mentoring (?)

I regularly receive personal feedback regarding my ability to explain subjects I know, and how I can help people to understand those subjects. I'm patient and willing to try a variety of approaches to explain different topics.
